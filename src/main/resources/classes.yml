# Add Classes as you wish but do not use spaces in names.
# Items are i:dxa, i=Item d=data a=Ammount.  Data and ammount are optional
# Each class must have at least 2 items, use the dummyitem if you only want 1
# The DummyItem can also be used as a spacer (examples bellow)
# Remember, potions can not be stacked
